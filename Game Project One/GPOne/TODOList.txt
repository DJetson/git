Classes
-------
KeyBindings -	A class that has a Dictionary<System.Windows.Input.Key,PlayerActions> which manages which player
				actions are bound to which keys. It should be fairly simple, but until there are more reliable objects
				to use this class with it would be needlessly difficult to get into place and working properly.

PlayerActions -	A base class which defines various PlayerAction Metadata (Name, Requirements, Upgrades, etc.) as well
				as a few abstract functions which, when defined, determine how a player object is altered by a given action.
